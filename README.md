# **Obstacle Detection using Arduino and Ultrasonic Sensor**

## **Aim**
The aim of this project is 
- To detect any obstacle within a specified range
- To calculate the distance of the obstacle from the sensor

## **Working Principle**
The distance is calculated based on the time of flight of the ultrasonic wave i.e. distance is calculated based on the time elapsed between the emission of the wave and the reception of the echo.

## **Components Required**
-
